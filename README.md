# ImageClassification

I designed this project using CNN(convolution neural networks). A neural network is trained to assign a label to an image based on its content. I used the CIFAR-10 dataset for the classification model. This project was created using the Pytorch library in Python. CNN is an extended version of Artificial Neural Network(ANN), which extracts features from grid-like matrix datasets, such as visual datasets like images.

The images are classified by calculating epochs and monitoring training metrics, we can systematically train models, ensuring they learn effectively without wasting resources.

Tools and Libraries Used:

1) PYTHON: The project is implemented using python

2) numpy: for numerical computation requirement
   PIL: for manipulating images 
   torch: open-source ML library used for creating deep neural networks, strong GPU support 
   torchvision: for image processing 
   matplotlib : for plotting epoch loss

3) Jupyter-lab: for development and analysis of the project 


DATASET USED: CIFAR-10 dataset. 

INSIGHTS:

Used CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification with Pytorch library in Python and CNN. The accuracy score turns out to be 85.064%.
